# Phishing-Detection-System-Using-ML


# Abstract  

Phishing attacks remain a prevalent threat to cybersecurity, leveraging deceptive tactics to trick users into divulging sensitive information.By leveraging a dataset of known phishing emails and legitimate communications, the system trains ML models to recognize patterns indicative of phishing attempts.

The system's effectiveness is evaluated through extensive testing on real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to accurately identify phishing emails with high precision and recall rates. Through the 
integration of ML algorithms, this phishing detection system provides an efficient and automated solution for mitigating the risks posed by phishing attacks in today's digital landscape.
